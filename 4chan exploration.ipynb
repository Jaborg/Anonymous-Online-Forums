two lads is\\nnow fully rehabilitated under a new identity and hasn\\'t had any issues? it can\\nwork i guess.  \\n  \\non the flip side, the other kid keeps getting relocated because he\\'s a

among other things, repeatedly) do you think\\nhe should be kept in prison for life or killed? and where do you think the\\nline should be drawn between kids who can be rehabilitated and the lost\\ncausers?\\n\\n >>8730582  \\ndid they ever found any conclusive evidence he was guilty?\\n\\n >>8730625  \\n>had a reputation for being a violent bully, even among his fellow blacks  \\n>had previously threatened young girls and even adult women on at least one\\noccasion  \\n>literally admitted to it when he was arrested and showed the weapon to a\\npolice officer  \\n  \\nhow much more proof do you need?\\n\\n damn this is so awful everytime i read about it. i think they handled it well\\nin regard jail until 18 but venables should shot. the parents should have been\\nlocked up with them too. poor bulger\\'s parents. what a dark cloud over your\\nlife. so much worse than a car wreck or something\\n\\n >>8730618  \\nvenables should be charged for any crimes he committed as an adult just as\\nanyone else would be. the fact he\\'s been getting free passes is a fucking\\ndisgrace.  \\n  \\nas soon as they enter adulthood they don\\'t deserve any second chances. but

\\nparents have become so removed from their children\\'s upbringing. i\\'m sure\\nthere is a few just born psychopaths out there (hence a trial would be good)\\nbut most criminals are that way because of their parents. there is no\\naccountability among parents in the west anymore. hence boomers leading to\\nsjws. a result of government step ins and hand outs\\n\\n >>8730618  \\ni think all

yellow tide flowing north and west from china.  \\n>therefore, the organization resorted to a combination of chemical,\\nbiological, and radiological means, on an enormous scale, to deal with the\\nproblem. over a period of four years some 16 million square miles of the\\nearth\\'s surface, from the ural mountains to the pacific and from the arctic\\nocean to the indian ocean, were effectively sterilized. thus was the great\\neastern waste created.  \\n>only in the last decade have certain areas of the waste been declared safe\\nfor colonization. even so, they are \"safe\" only in the sense that the poisons\\nsowed there a century ago have abated to the point that they are no longer a\\nhazard to life. as everyone is aware, the bands of mutants which roam the\\nwaste remain a real threat, and it may be another century before the last of\\nthem has been eliminated and white colonization has once again established a\\nhuman presence throughout this vast area  \\n>among those uncounted thousands earl turner played no small part. he gained\\nimmortality for himself on that dark november day 106 years ago when he\\nfaithfully fulfilled his obligation to his race, to the organization, and to\\nthe holy order which had accepted him into its ranks. and in so doing he\\nhelped greatly to assure that his race would survive and prosper, that the\\norganization would

interned at my unis archive.\\nmy final semester of uni, a bachelor\\'s degree was no longer good enough for an\\nentry level position. you needed an mls degree and multiple years of\\nexperience at a minimum. starting pay for an entry level position was roughly\\n30k a year (if you\\'re lucky, more than likely it\\'s part time at fucking $15-20\\nan hour). getting a mls is not worth that in any country. that\\'s why i\\'m\\nsalty. i didn\\'t get my degree to teach but i can\\'t even do that in my state\\nunless i get a teaching license which would require me to go back to school\\nfor two years. again, not worth it.  \\n  \\nto recap, i got my degree for a single purpose and got cucked out of it my\\nfinal semester despite being more than qualified to do it and the alternative\\nis

>>8725899  \\n>read my extremely fringe literature  \\nno, i won’t do that. integrating africans who are far more distant genetically\\nfrom europeans is much harder than integrating them with those

\\nanon, the point of colonization was to cut out the middleman and extract the\\nresources that would have been traded\\n\\n >>8725899  \\n>integrating groups under a shared nationality and history  \\nthis is fundamentally incompatible with multiculturalism and you know it. the\\nassilationist program you\\'re describing is the american melting pot and its\\nunacceptable to modern progressives.\\n\\n the org for african unity accepted the post-colonial border settlement after\\ndecolonisation for reasons of stability, for good reason - muh clay could\\npotentially be a huge cause for conflict in certain parts of africa but has\\nbeen to a large extent averted.  \\n  \\nthe main problem with colonial borders is that they reflect european\\npoliticking rather than pre-colonial state formations, economies,\\ndemographics, etc. most african countries as a result are too low in\\npopulation and poor in resources to be viable as independent states. this is\\none reason why pan-africanism has been and continues to be such a prevalent\\nideology throughout africa.\\n\\n >>8726329  \\nretarded argument. if this correlation was causative like you\\'re suggesting we\\ncould expect portuguese colonies with 500 years of european genetics to do\\nbetter, but they don\\'t.  \\nsouth africa is incredibly rich in resources, minerals, etc. it had some of\\nthe most developed pre-colonial formations e.g. zulu and ndebele kingdoms for\\nthis reason. all whites did was used forced labour to enrich themselves.  \\nin fact at the time of the boer treks there are quite a lot of accounts of\\nnative tribes picking up agriculture from europeans and out-competing boer\\nsettlers, at which point the boer states step in to take their land, massacre\\nthem, and force them in to a reservation (which later became the bantustans).\\n\\n >>8725666  \\nyou will never be french\\n\\n >>8726635  \\n>most african countries as a result are too low in population and poor in\\nresources to be viable as independent states.  \\nthis is an extremely major reason as to why this is a huge issue. in addition,\\nlots of them are paranoid about european powers who may seem to be\\n\"influencing\" them simply because of trade/donation incentives, which\\ntranslates to a population which can\\'t trust the other due to both of them\\nlacking in resources, but the people helping them being foreigners. even if\\nangola and congo wanted to unify as states independent from all non-african\\npowers, that would startle all of their neighbors, making them panic that\\nthere\\'s some kind of other force guiding these decisions (not to mention\\nstirring up panic in the potential angola-congolese union of potential\\neuropean meddling in potential future negotiations), but they also wouldn\\'t\\nhave the simple tools to stand purely independent of all foreign trade and\\nindustry because the resources within their nations proper simply wouldn\\'t\\namount to what is needed to fuel themselves indefinitely. this is all\\ndiscounting constant regional issues (periodic warlords and bandits,\\nrevolutionaries, erratic and hostile weather conditions causing droughts and\\nfamines, etc.), because before we even get to that, in an ideal sense, they\\ncan\\'t operate as individuals.  \\n  \\nif some african nation decided to begin investing heavily in their own\\nlocalized agriculture and future industry such that they could be entire\\nindependent from foreign trade, you\\'d probably see less concerns with regard\\nto european meddling and more on their border neighbors, but as it stands now,\\nyou\\'ll never see it because they\\'re usually too poor to survive without\\neuropean aid, and thus perpetuates this unending cycle of suspicion towards\\nneighbors and constant finger-pointing while greedily accepting handouts in\\nspite of prior debacles.\\n\\n >>8726792  \\nwhat about botswana, they\\'ve seemed to dodge the resource curse albiet with an\\nextremely small population\\n\\n >>8725401  \\n>b-but other africans would\\'ve killed them anyways  \\ni don\\'t see any large genocides in pre-colonization africa in the congo. why\\ndo you believe that they would\\'ve purposefully killed a generation of their\\nown people? it\\'s speculation, and i prefer to utilize the fact that they\\'re\\nrational human beings.\\n\\n >>8726796  \\nnot him, but botswana was in an advantageous position during the raucous era\\nof decolonization and immediately thereafter. they\\'re in the midst of a water\\ncrisis tho. regardless, botswana is exception because they were fortunate\\nenough to have relatively stable neighbors.  \\n  \\n>>8726807  \\nbro the zulu killed a million and displaced millions more in the 19th century.\\nshut the fuck up.\\n\\n >>8725664  \\nthey were objecting to it because although the aggressor wanted to unite an\\nethnic group, the crackpot dictator or government that the us or soviets\\ninstalled saw it as a direct breach of their sovereignty as a state. this is\\nretarded, it\\'s like claiming france should\\'ve just let germany walk in and\\nbeat the shit out of it in

period of internally induced black-on-black destruction.\\ninstead, cobbing argued that the roots of the conflicts could be found\\nexclusively in the labour needs of the portuguese slave traders operating out\\nof delagoa bay, in modern-day mozambique, and of the british colonists in the\\ncape. the resulting pressures led to massive displacement, famine, and war in\\nthe interior, allowing later afrikaner settlers to seize control of most\\nland.[15] among those involved were european adventurers such as nathaniel\\nisaacs (who was later accused of slave trading).[16]  \\nyep i\\'m sure

same\\nprinciple can be seen in christianity and islam with fasting. the rulers never\\nadhered to these rules privately, they were made for the plebs to weaken them.  \\n  \\ntoday vegetarianism and veganism along with other such nonsense is shilled in\\norder to reengineer a new slave caste.\\n\\n >>8722875  \\nit\\'s a meme that has a basis in truth.\\n\\n >>8722875  \\nthis is a hg venus, not

humanity has ever produced or\\ndiscovered to this day points to and all powerful all great being that not\\nonly is the master of reality, but is also reality itself.  \\n  \\nbefore i build on this premise, i must make it clear that i do not know if god\\nexist or not, as no one else knows either. we can claim to be theist or\\natheist, but in reason we are all agnostic in a metaphysical sence as not only\\ncan we not study or idealize god direclty, no one has the same definition of\\ngod that another person has. you cannot just argue about god like he is\\nanother political subject or scientific theory, as everyone has their own\\nunique perception of god, even if they believe in him or not. to some god is a\\nman in the sky, to others he is an omnipresent entity that is exist on levels\\nbeyond time-space. some believe god is an authoritarian figure that is used to\\ncontrol people, and to others he is liberating force from the temptation of\\nsin and evil. religion both convirges and conflicts our perceptions of god,\\nbut humanity still has no collective idea as to the true understanding of gods\\nnature, nor may we ever achieve such an in depth theological understanding of\\ngod.  \\n  \\nwith that said, i personally believe in god because i believe that god is a\\nsummation of everything that we as humans deem to be great, glorious,\\nrightous, just, kind, careing, thoughtful, trustworthy, generous, brave,\\ncreative, beutiful, ect. i cannot express my understanding of god through\\nlanguage, so i will call god \"good\". this good is that universal being that\\nwich god is, and in order to understand why good exist, we can divide good\\ninto 3 equal principles that we all ready know exist. these 3 natures of god\\nare as what fallows:  \\ngod is light (the father)  \\ngod is love (the son)  \\ngod is life (the spirit)  \\n  \\nthus god is the summation of these things, and from these things we can derive\\ngood. the absence of good is what we call \"evil\".\\n\\n >>8721140  \\n>where might you, mad lad, think you are?  \\nin an image-board full of schizos.\\n\\n >>8721528  \\nso you can deny the existance of god, but can you deny the existance of love,\\nof light, of light? even though humanity does not have one perception of god,\\nwe all share a perception of the 3 natures of god. if you believe in these 3\\nnatures than you basically believe in god, even though you cannot understand\\ngod, you can still see him, you can feel him, hear him. and if you believe in\\nthe concept of good and evil than you also believe in god, as you understand\\nin a higher justice as well. you may not believe god exist, but at the some\\ntime you believe that all of his natures exist is a paradox. and after all,\\nthe only thing that you are sure exist is your free will in the end.\\n\\n we\\'re all one, and god is the way we reconcile that concept\\n\\n >>8721451  \\nthis is really moronic and i\\'m disappointed if that\\'s a real quote because\\ni\\'ve wanted to read his books on christianity for quite some time now. you can\\ntrust your brain because you can reasonably assume it has evolved a high\\ndegree of

exact opposite of what he\\nsays, the more you stray away from observations of nature (it\\'s raining, a\\nlion is chasing me) into more abstract discussion (god is real, there is a\\nplatonic world of ideas, man has a soul) the less accurate you tend to be,\\nsimply because the job of your brain is to ensure survival, not have a\\nphilosophical discussion. your brain needs enough confidence to

no explanation; but which is quantifiable in brain\\nchemistry and expressed through unfalsifiable action. it is no evidence of\\nanything supernatural.  \\n  \\n\\'light\\' is a narrow band in the

to be a first\\nsource for everything to happen. i disagree with this.  \\nthere is no reason to think that the universe hasn\\'t always existed. in that\\nbefore the big bang the universe was always sitting there, and empty void with\\na singularity of everything in it. the universe exists because its not really\\nsomething that needed to be created.  \\nas for where that original singularity came from, that is a much more useful\\npoint to argue against. and as far as i am aware there isn\\'t any real\\nexplanation as to where the singularity originated, if it had an \\'originating\\npoint\\' at all.  \\n  \\nargument 3 is based on the same idea that there needs to be _something_ that\\nstarts everything. that makes things exist in the universe.  \\nagain i disagree with this. its perhaps a valid view that there was no reality\\nbefore the singularity and that it created what we think of as reality on its\\nvery own. in this there is no \\'before\\', before the singularity, there is only\\n\\'after\\' it.  \\n  \\nfor the 4th argument i really don\\'t find anything convincing here.  \\nthings can be compared to other things to determine better or worse as far as\\ntraits go. there does not need to be a concrete example of what is better than\\nall else for one to make a judgement based on relative qualities between\\ndifferent beings.  \\n  \\nthe 5th argument is countered by that there is no direction to life and\\nthings.  \\npeople have no greater purpose beyond some base impulses to fuck, eat, and\\nsleep. and same goes for everything else in the universe. there is no greater\\npurpose to life.  \\nif one wants to find direction they have to create it themselves.\\n\\n >>8717407  \\n>give your best argument for god\\'s

cliche atheist\\nretort of \"old man in the sky\" is obviously not true because god as the\\ncreator is not an anthropomorphic entity but probably something more like a\\nfirst principle or underlying cause of existence itself that causes it to be\\nrather than not to be. so why is he referred to as a heavenly father? probably\\nbecause wisdom could be defined as having an understanding of the true nature\\nof things which ultimately proceeds from this first principle. wisdom is\\narchetypally associated as coming from a father figure so the heavenly father\\nis also the immaterial source from whence our earthly fathers ultimately\\ninherited their wisdom and passed it down to us. so why pray to god or have\\nrituals if he\\'s not a person like us? probably because prayers and rituals are\\ndeeply tied to our psychology, especially our subconscious mind. our\\nconscious, subconscious, and rational mind are all contingent upon this first\\nprinciple/source of all things and therefore by acting out rituals and prayers\\nthen we are directly communing with that underlying force which enables us to\\nact in that way in the first place. hope that makes some sense.\\n\\n

years after the end of slavery with where they stood after 30\\nyears of the liberal welfare state. in other words, we could compare hard\\nevidence on “the legacy of slavery” with hard evidence on the legacy of\\nliberals.  \\n  \\n>despite the grand myth that black economic progress began or accelerated with\\nthe passage of the civil rights laws and “war on poverty” programs of the\\n1960s, the cold fact is that the poverty rate among blacks fell from 87\\npercent in 1940 to 47 percent by 1960. this was before any of those programs\\nbegan.  \\n  \\n>over the next 20 years, the poverty rate among blacks fell another 18\\npercentage points, compared to the 40-point drop in the previous 20 years.\\nthis was the continuation of a previous economic trend, at a slower rate of\\nprogress, not the economic grand deliverance proclaimed by liberals and self-\\nserving black “leaders.”  \\n  \\n>nearly a hundred years of the supposed “legacy of slavery” found most black\\nchildren [78%] being raised in two-parent families in 1960. but thirty years\\nafter the liberal welfare state found the great majority of black children\\nbeing raised by a single parent [66%]. public housing projects in the first\\nhalf of the 20th century were clean, safe places, where people slept outside\\non hot summer nights, when they were too poor to afford air conditioning. that\\nwas before admissions standards for public housing projects were lowered or\\nabandoned, in the euphoria of liberal non-judgmental notions. and it was\\nbefore the toxic message of victimhood was spread by liberals. we all know\\nwhat hell holes public housing has become in our times. the same toxic message\\nproduced similar social results among lower-income people in england, despite\\nan absence of a “legacy of slavery” there.  \\n  \\nif we are to go by evidence of social retrogression, liberals have wreaked\\nmore havoc on blacks than the supposed “legacy of slavery” they talk about.\\n\\n

front in an effort\\nto take back the holy land (pontic-caspian steppe) from the russians, this is\\nwhy italian fascists didn’t like slavs, they understood that slavs such as\\ncroatians were bruitsh invaders encroaching upon true italian lands. fascist\\nsuperhuman soldiers were unopposed on the eastern front and had made it to the\\nflanks of the germans who were at stalingrad, the spiritual capital of the\\nindo european homeland and greater steppe, when their positions were\\ncompromised due to slavic hordes and gyspy invaders from india “romanians”\\nfailing to beat back said hordes. the fascist superhuman forces were so close\\nto victory and fought tooth and nail against the red army which greatly\\noutnumbered them, unlike the barbarians which were trapped in the city, the\\nfascists (trojans) were smart enough to escape with a significant amount of\\nthe force being able to flee annihilation from the slav hordes. the war in the\\neast was a spiritual conflict and was of far more significance than any\\n“battle” over some material wasteland on an entirely different continent.  \\n  \\npic related: actual soviet hordes took two weeks to defeat trapped fascist\\nwarriors in winter even though they had 9x as many men and had real material\\nsupport. the soviets likely utilized uralic and altaic warriors as a means to\\ndefeat the noble trojans, this was a common tactic the soviets used to win\\ndecisive battles, just look at the haplogroup maps. leningrad was won by\\nrussians who were closer to finns (uralics), moscow was won by siberian\\ndivisions and just to the east of the stalingrad does non slavic y-dna become\\nthe majority, it becomes clear that the slav hordes alone could not defeat the\\ntrojans.\\n\\n >>8727525

just\\nlike the 2d can withhold an infinite 1d.  \\nif you had a, say, 2d square before, in the third dimension add as many planes\\noutside along the vector perpendicular to the original 2d square to form a\\ncube, and now you have a 3d object.  \\n  \\nyou have to understand that dimensions are not an object. a dimension is a\\n-limit-  \\n1d. a single point along a line in space-time. its limit is the line  \\n2d. an area across a possible infinite plane in space-time, where that point\\ncan reside. its limit is the flat area  \\n3d. we\\'re here, the 3rd dimensional world. the point can go along the 1d line,\\nthe 2d plane and it can now move in height, on a vector perpendicular to the\\n2d plane. its limit is the space.  \\n  \\njust as the 2d is a plane where an infinite 1d can reside, the 3d is where an\\ninfinite 2d planes can be stacked one upon another.  \\n(cont)\\n\\n along the 1d line, a hypothetical 2d light shone upon a 2d object (say a\\nsquare) in the 2d world will only appear as a line. a shadow. that\\'s the sum\\nof all understanding that the 1d inhabitants will have of the square. the 1d\\ninhabitants can theorize that the 2d exists, they can see and perceive its\\nline shadow with all their limited senses, but can not comprehend its scope.  \\nin the 2d plane, a 3d light shone upon a 3d object in the 3d world will only\\nappear as a flat imprint. a shadow. that\\'s the sum of all understanding that\\nthe 3d inhabitants will have of the cube. the 2d inhabitants can theorize that\\nthe 3d exists, they can see and perceive its flat shadow with all their\\nlimited senses, but can not comprehend its scope.  \\nin the 3d space, a 4d light shone upon a 4d object in the 4d world will appear\\nas a fully realized 3d object. that\\'s the shadow. that\\'s the sum of all\\nunderstanding that the 3d inhabitants will have of the 4d object; only by it\\'s\\n3d imprint on their 3d space-world. we, the 3d inhabitants can theorize that\\nthe 4d exists, we can see and perceive its 3d shadows with all their limited\\nsenses, but can not comprehend its scope.  \\n  \\ncompared to the 3d, the 4d is both up, down, forward, backward, within and\\nwithout at the same time. our souls are the vector connecting our selves\\n(including this 3d body) to the world above. i don\\'t know if there is an above\\nbeyond 4d. maybe there is. what i\\'m saying is that this very limited 3d world\\nis merely an unreal shadow.\\n\\n the shadow world is what we are currently experiencing through our fleshy 3d\\nbodies, but it is not the real world. as above, so below. we are below, merely\\ngrasping on the shadow of what is above.  \\ni feel like i\\'m reaching a conclusion here, like all of my innate intuition,\\ngained knowledge, bits and pieces of experience finally connect to reveal a\\ngreater scope than the sum of its parts. if reincarnation is in any way real,\\nthis will be my last stretch of any perceivable time in this finite

you\\'d be seeing events like 1953 all the time, which you\\ndidn\\'t. as to your other point: there were warnings for 1953. the sed\\nconducted surveys to gauge the mood of the population in spring in that year,\\nand found worker hostility to the measures put in place since the\\n\\'construction of socialism\\' in 1952. it wasn\\'t magical by any means, and the\\ngovernment made concessions regarding the price rises put into place in april,\\nso it\\'s not like increasing discontent was not known.\\n\\n >>8712765  \\nthe sed is a perfectly valid source, but i don\\'t expect you to accept it since\\nyou\\'re a pathological anti-communist whose grandfather was probably one of the\\nhooligans who tried to overthrow socialism. there were plenty of attempted\\ncoups like hungary 1956 and czechoslovakia 1968, but the vast majority of\\npeople supported the socialist system so they failed and had no popular basis.\\na coup doesn\\'t just happen easily and any hardship of the gdr was a result of\\nit actually paying reparations in industry unlike west germany. there has\\nnever been a single \"protest\" in a socialist country that wasn\\'t an attempt to\\noverthrow the state and

their leaders, gobbling up whatever party\\nline is presented to you on any given day.\\n\\n >>8712947  \\nit challenged them for barely a week, that\\'s how irrelevant it was. you\\nhaven\\'t provided any proof that the cia and bnd wasn\\'t involved. i never\\nclaimed the gdr was a utopia, to think socialism is utopian is a false picture\\npainted by the enemies of socialism to mock the proletarian movement (the\\nnazis were very fond of sarcastically describing the ussr as a workers and\\npeasants paradise). there was plenty of room for debate in the gdr, but the\\nvast majority never resorted to trying to overthrow the state and became\\nslaves for capital, even today after 30 years of frg rule most prefer the\\nsocialist system.

\\njews are white\\n\\n >>8729194  \\n>everyone i don\\'t like is jewish!!!!!!!!!\\n\\n slavery is a bad institution but it\\'s a compromise with the biological reality\\nthat some humans are about as capable of sustaining themselves through markets\\nand free exchange as dogs are. likewise, some humans are capable of sustaining\\nthemselves through markets and free exchange but only by replicating the labor\\nof livestock. it\\'s a strange question whether it\\'s better to will that humans\\nbe broad and diverse enough in nature to include effective livestock among\\ntheir ranks or whether such humans should be discarded and allowed to die for\\nthe sake of allowing lesser creatures to fill those respective niches, and the\\nquestion can be extended wlog to questions of human biodiversity itself. in\\nthe long term, intelligence augmentation allows for some solutions, but\\ncreates new problems. in conclusion i don\\'t fucking know lol\\n\\n >>8729971  \\nretard\\n\\n >>8730009

posted it i’m going to post it\\nagain. its well established that american blacks have around 20% non-african\\nadmixture due to female slaves getting fucked, consensually and not\\nconsensually, by their owners. if jews, at the time in the south they would be\\npredominantly sephardic jews, were supposedly such prolific slave owners, how\\ncome american blacks have almost no sephardic jewish dna? how come the\\noverwhelming majority of the non-african dna they have is from anglo and\\nscottish sources?\\n\\n someone hurry up and answer my question here >>8730109  \\ni need to know how

about ww2.\\n\\n you stupid fucker. jesus christ. your thinking of the 1943 battle of kiev,\\nwell the year before, the germans launched a offensive in the south for the\\noil fields. the battle of moscow would happen 1941 and 1942. when the germans\\nwere stopped, they needed dat oil to stay in the offensive. army group south\\nwas split up, one to keep the farmlands of ukraine and army group a

of course the weather was allowed to\\nturn and stalin was given more time to prepare. all these factors contributed\\nto the loss and they were predicted by generals at the time who

on moscow, which they are, they are not anywhere near where they would\\nneed to be to defend from the soviet armies in kiev. soviet infrastructure is\\nsparse and rail is on a different gauge, so you\\'re either wearing them out\\ndriving back to blunt the soviets or waiting on engineers to actually get rail\\nservice to move the divisions. neither of which you can afford. glantz even\\nsaid

continuous dividing of forces combined\\nwith the endless delay that bogged down the offensive  \\nare you going to provide specifics or just rely on generalized hyperbole in\\nhopes of convincing the unwitting that you\\'re smarter than you are? because\\nbarbarossa expected units to change the path of advance should the opportunity\\npresent itself to make major encirclements. destruction of a military force\\nconsisting of about 30% of the entire invasion force definitely counts for\\nthis. they did not go gallivanting to kiev over an armored division, they\\ndiverted to destroy a soviet army that had the potential to end the war in the\\nsoviet favor in 1941.  \\n  \\n>an invested moscow is a moscow that can\\'t bring in reinforcements at any\\nuseful speed anyway.  \\nthere are rail lines going west to places other than moscow. taking moscow\\ndoes not mean reinforcements stop to all fronts. taking moscow is also going\\nto be nearly impossible for germany. germany is at the end of a very long and\\ntenuous supply line with units at about 50% of their starting strength,\\nfighting an entrenched enemy in an urban area. germany does not have the\\ninfantry to both take it and

adams was publishing editorials in\\nwhich he insinuated that \"papism\" was secretly infiltrating the colonies by\\nway of england. american revolutionary war propaganda also made frequent\\ncomparisons between the king and the pope, and a common conspiracy theory was\\nthat rome and london were somehow in league with one another in order to\\nrestore an illiberal world order.  \\nin the decades leading up to the revolution we are also to remark the great\\nawakenings that more or less swept through the entire colonial societies.\\nsure, many of the founders were deists, but

you.\\nutilitarianism would claim that the shooter did a good thing, and the moral\\nworth in the situation is the same as if he had shot you save your life. but\\nthere is a clear difference between to the two situations that utilitarianism\\ndoes not account for.  \\ni’ll present one more situation  \\n>if only actions have moral worth, and if therefore one should act to bring\\nthe most good forward, is it therefore justifiable, even recommended, to tie\\nup your rich grandma and send all her money to charity. she may be unhappy,\\nbut your action has brought more happiness then

uncomfortable\\nwhen, in analyzing my own life, most of my decisions are motivated by pursuit\\nif personal happiness or the happiness of others. what i settled on is that\\nconscious life has intrinsic worth (even when it’s devoid of pleasure,) and a\\nsociety like the one depicted in the comic is effectively a mass suicide of\\nhumanity, because we have ceased living, moving and communicating.\\n\\n >>8710828  \\ni don\\'t know what it is, but fuck it.  \\nwhat do i win?\\n\\n >>8713136  \\nthe similar cartoon where robots make humans suffer for eternity instead.\\n\\n

states identified as a fulfilled human life in you, then\\nyou would be effectively living that life. also we know people become\\ndesensitised to pain and pleasure. so somehow these robots would have to\\nincrease dopamine exponentially (impossible).... finally, if there were a\\nworld of post-scarcity then people would be free of conflict and insecurities,\\nthe hierarchies that organise scarce

disappears\\nat death which means there\\'s no regretting or suffering for any length of time\\nafter the button is pushed. to insist on creating life and perpetuating more\\nbeings who rely on

account for\\nnotions such as duty? let’s say burning your daughter alive would bring\\nincredible joy and happiness to three people, that would ‘outweigh’ the pain\\nof your daughter, you would hardly kill your own daughter, it’s a clear\\nviolation of basic moral intuition.  \\n>misrepresenting utilitarianism  \\nutilitarianism is concerned with consequences of actions. the actions\\nthemselves are not considered in determining moral worth. again, that’s how\\nit’s a system that can ultimately justify slavery and all other manner of\\nobvious wrong-doing, so long as one believes it brings more happiness then it\\ndoes suffering on the whole. but slavery is obviously wrong.\\n\\n >>8716650  \\n>violation of basic moral intuition  \\nalmost as if basic intuitions are

a huge statistic anomaly, and its not exactly know what\\nmakes something sentient, so thats even less likely.\\n\\n >>8717600  \\n>so you have no reason to believe it would be conscious even if simulating an\\norganic computer  \\nif it can develop and explain ideas creativly, invent and conceptualize itself\\nvia self-awareness i would suspect that such computer mind would be conscious.\\nour i-ness is after all a simulation of the brain functions and i see no\\nimpossibility of re-creating such simulation within the context of a computer.\\nif the neuronal functions, which are the basis of our thinking, can be\\nsimulated than there is nothing that should stop one to make a self-aware ai.  \\n  \\nthe most advanced ais today work on the principle of a neural net, in the\\nfuture the complexity and connectivity will probably be increased so that an\\nai complexity could mirror a human brain. this does not mean that the machine\\nwill become sapient because it has the potential for sapience. it has to be\\ngiven a reason for sapience otherwise it will not develop sapience, but it is\\ngiven a reason for developing it, it will emerge slowly. the environment will\\nbe most important as the ai can change its code effortless, we cannot change\\nour dna and neural mind-structures as easily as an ai. it will probably behave\\nlike a mega autist but refine its understanding until it can interact with\\nhumans without any problem. such a \"childhood\" will probably take many years.  \\nai will need bias to function, but the bias doesn’t necessarily have to be\\nhuman. an ai\\'s environment is not human and even if you base all its\\nexperience around human, this will not make it a human mind inside a metal\\nchassis, it will always be non-human. sapience will still make it a person\\nthough and through sophonce ai and human can meet each other.\\n\\n >>8718514  \\nan ai with that can think abstractly enough has necessarily to be able to\\nchange its code, as this the only way it can reflect on its choice and\\nmodificate its behavior. i believe it\\'s easier for an ai to modificate its\\ncode because by its nature it can fully view its internal mental processes and\\nmake much more extensive and detailed revisions to its own programming but in\\nthe other it can also be harder because the mind of an ai hasn\\'t its origin in\\nthe blind chaos of evolution, it is the product of human design and the codes\\nfrom which it emerges cannot easily be managed as human instincts.  \\nsimply increasing computational power will not result in strong (humanlike)\\nai. the advanced \"deep\" neural networks used now are basically fancy versions\\nof neural networks with multiple hidden layers that learn abstractions from\\nlower level input layers. people suggesting here that quantitative\\ncomputational increases will allow such neural networks to become sentient or\\ndevelop humanlike ai are mistaken. we still are very far away from real\\nhumanlike ai. and it\\'s not just because exponential growth of processing power\\nis becoming linear. it\\'s because current ai research is ignoring crucial\\naspects of cognition. something like consciousness will not suddenly arise as\\na neural network increases in computational potential. it\\'s dependent on\\nspecific configurations of cognitive functions interacting asymmetrically and\\nhierarchically within an embodied framework. the human brain which gives rise\\nto human intelligence and thus to aspects like sentience is characterized by\\nmore than just connections of neurons. to name but a few: there is specific\\ninterconnectivity between brain regions, i.e. some areas are more\\ninterconnected than others, areas have different types of neurons and\\nneurotransmitters, and there are oscillatory mechanics which synchronize or\\ndesynchronize areas of the brain.\\n\\n >>8718550  \\nwhile i don\\'t think we need to replicate the exact human brain structure to\\nget humanlike ai, some of the brain dynamics will have to be similar in order\\nto get a similar type of intelligence. imo, it will take increased processing\\npower + specific configurations of interconnected neural networks with for\\nexample hierarchical feedback loops (resembling gradients of abstract thinking\\nin neocortex) to get close to anything resembling strong ai or sentience.\\n\\n >>8717415  \\nexploration could not exceed chemical bliss. also exploration would take up\\nfar more resources for far less happieness.  \\n>>8717265  \\nthe heat death is coming

utilitarianism? this is not intent that is\\nquestionable, it\\'s the method really.\\n\\n what is plasure?\\n\\n >>8716874  \\n>moral intuition isn’t always right  \\nyes, obviously, but you the intuition that you shouldn’t murder your daughters\\nfor the pleasure of strangers is correct, and your system of thought is so far\\nunable to account for that.  \\n>slavery is justifiable!  \\nexactly my point, utilitarianism is a terrible ethical system that allows\\npeople to justify placing immense suffering on people because  \\n>moar good!  \\nit’s a literal brainlet theory that doesn’t take into account actual reality,\\nand reduces what we should and shouldn’t do into a single equation; the\\nfelicific calculus. it’s so far away from a theory of ethics you can apply in\\nthe real world, and saying edgy shit like  \\n>i’d burn own daughter alive!  \\n>i’d enslave an entire populace!  \\n>i’d kill everyone on the planet!  \\njust because some dingy little equation tells you you should, demonstrates how\\nautistic the entire the theory really is.\\n\\n >>8717549  \\nbut utilitarianism doesnt care about you. in the equation of good and bad, you\\ncount for one, your grandma counts for 1, and each homeless alcoholic counts\\nfor 1. therefore, you would have to sell your grannies shit regardless of how\\nyou feel about it. utilitarianism doesn’t care about your personal loyalties\\nand duties, that’s one reason why it’s such a terrible ethical system.\\n\\n >>8723642  \\nwow, it\\'s almost like your hatred of utilitarianism stems from a complete lack\\nof understanding thereof. first of all it\\'s not a system, it\\'s a theory of\\nnormative ethics. second of all, \"counts for 1\" is absolutely meaningless,\\nnothing about utilitarianism is congruent with equating a person\\'s life with a\\nmoment of comfort for another person. thirdly, a system that requires you to\\ndo something \"regardless of how you feel about it\" in order to maximize\\nhappiness is self-defeating- you may think this is a valid criticism of\\nutilitarianism, but in reality it indicates that your argument is a strawman.\\n\\n >>8723632  \\n>i cannot comprehend a theory unless it is codified in a system that follows\\nit to the letter  \\n>therefore the theory is autistic\\n\\n >>8710828  \\na form of utilitarianism more like that presented by bentham and john stuart\\nmill which takes into account \"higher pleasure\" is superior to pure hedonistic\\nutilitarianism.  \\n  \\nhu is impossible and self-destructive, outside forces who never take the first\\nhit for cultural reasons will grow in strength materially and eventually just\\ngenocide the beings in the pleasure vats. you might argue \"this simply means\\nwe must take precautions against this, it does not *fundamentally* disprove\\nhu\", however there are indeed fundamental reasons to avoid it, if happiness is\\nthe pleasure of sapient beings, it follows that the being must be sapient and\\nhow can we be sure these beings are sapient after 100s of years of having\\ntheir brains fried? at this point they are more like a chemical reaction, to\\nactivate the neuroreceptors associated with pleasure in a bit of neurotissue\\nin a vat.  \\n  \\na \"brave new world\" is a society where outsiders can choose to take the first\\nhit, but more realistically in the distant future authoritarian regimes will\\nsimply force the last outsiders to comply. to avoid getting to that point we\\nneed a political culture that values liberty and freedom above hedonism, you\\ncan be a consoomer, but with the facet that you remain in control, you never\\nlet someone bribe you into giving up your rights because \"it good feel\". if\\nyou are a slave to cooming you will become a slave to others.\\n\\n >>8723728  \\n>counts for 1  \\nis not absolutely meaningless. easiest way to prove this the trolley\\nexperiment  \\n>two strangers on one track  \\n>your daughter on another  \\nutilitarianism holds that you’d save the two and let your daughter die.\\nbecause she, despite being your daughter, receives no special considerations\\nunder this theory.  \\n>it’s self-defeating to do things regardless of how you feel about it  \\nyeah, obviously dude. but utilitarianism holds that you should do things\\nregardless of what you think or feel, to maximize good.  \\nnot sure where you’re getting off on the supposed intellectual superiority,\\nsounds like you really don’t get the central claims of utilitarianism and how\\nthey play out.\\n\\n >>8723759  \\n>totally misunderstanding my criticism, which is that it lacks flexibility,\\nand must be followed the letter, hence a fucking equation to determine how one\\nshould act.\\n\\n >>8723805  \\n>utilitarianism holds that you’d save the two and let your daughter die.\\nbecause she, despite being your daughter, receives no special considerations\\nunder this theory.  \\nluckily we don\\'t live in a thought experiment and in real life we apply as\\nmany special considerations as we want. in reality you\\'d know your daughter is\\nyour daughter, the two strangers could be gay pedophile rapists with aids for\\nall you know.  \\n  \\n>but utilitarianism holds that you should do things regardless of what you\\nthink or feel, to maximize good.  \\nno, that\\'s exactly the opposite of what it is. what **feels** good **is**\\ngood. ergo you should always do what feels good, except in situations where it\\nwould make other people feel bad to a more significant extent.\\n\\n >>8723811  \\nso your real criticism is an even bigger strawman?\\n\\n >>8714585  \\nunless...?\\n\\n >>8723879  \\nsays the anon who refused to address any of the points i made to set up some\\nbullshit green

stealing from granny, lying to your wife, or enslaving people.\\nall these things either go against moral intuition, or/and there are reasoned\\nmoral and ethical arguments against them. yet, utilitarianism ultimately can\\njustify each one.  \\nyou’ve asked me to refute utilitarianism, but instead of addressing my\\narguments about the separation of utilitarianism from basic moral principles\\nsuch as duty and common-sense moral intuition, you’ve just displayed ignorance\\nand bad faith.\\n\\n >>8724169  \\n>are utilitarianism’s central two claims not thus  \\n>the only thing

bible of utilitarianism or anything, but for the\\nsake of argument, sure, let\\'s go with that.  \\n  \\n>how we feel or our loved ones feel is not more important than what anyone\\nelse feels from this standpoint.  \\nyou misunderstand my argument. in making a moral calculation, you are much\\nmore certain of the amount of happiness your daughter\\'s life brings than those\\nof any two strangers, so it behooves you to consider her before them. it\\'s\\nlike determining the sigfigs in a physics equation. sure, maybe if we had a\\nfancy pantsy omniscient only-possible-in-a-thought-experiment ai that could\\ndetermine for sure what the happiness quotient brought about by each person\\'s\\nlife is, then maybe they would decide that those strangers are worth more than\\nyour daughter. and i would admit that if we were talking about saving two\\nstrangers versus one, then the best bet would be to go with saving two. but\\nyou\\'re not so sure of that, this is your daughter we\\'re talking about. she\\nbrings you happiness, and you\\'re quite sure of that, right?\\n\\n >>8717600  \\n>you can only reasonably conclude that other humans and

without killing their own kind endlessly.  \\neven in nature there is a concept of territory belonging to a certain\\nindividual in which you cross at your own risk and detriment to your well\\nbeing. the only way private property can be avoided is collectivizing the\\nproperty, meaning it now belongs to a group (as it\\'s the case with \"socilism\")\\nbut even then you are not making it freely available to everyone, only those\\npeople of that certain groups who decide not only to contribute to said\\nproperty but also decided in how that property should and would be used. in\\nthe end it\\'s still private property belonging to a group.otherwise you have\\nrouges coming into said property taking all it\\'s worth and leaving without any\\nregard for those who improved or made or

and private be one and the same. meaning if you decide as a\\nsociety that everyone will blind a collective farm and that will be public\\nthan that is that, it\\'s fine and you didn\\'t destroy

grew. the arizona territory\\'s \"thieving thirteenth\"\\nlegislature approved the university of arizona in 1885 and selected the city\\nof tucson to receive the appropriation to build the university. tucson hoped\\nto receive the appropriation for the territory\\'s mental hospital, which\\ncarried a $100,000 allocation instead of the $25,000 allotted to the\\nterritory\\'s only university (arizona state university was also chartered in\\n1885, but it was created as arizona\\'s normal school, and not a university).\\nflooding on the salt river delayed tucson\\'s legislators, and by they time they\\nreached prescott, back-room deals allocating the most desirable territorial\\ninstitutions had been made. tucson was largely disappointed with receiving\\nwhat was viewed as an inferior prize. with no parties willing to provide land\\nfor the new institution, the citizens of tucson prepared to return the money\\nto the territorial legislature until two gamblers and a saloon keeper decided\\nto donate the land to build the school. construction of old main, the first\\nbuilding on campus, began on october 27, 1887, and classes met for the first\\ntime in 1891 with 32 students in old main, which is still in use today.\\nbecause there were no high schools in arizona territory, the university\\nmaintained separate preparatory classes for the first 23 years of operation.\\n\\n

အဝီစိငရဲ) is the lowest level of the naraka or \"hell\" realm, with the\\nmost suffering, into which the dead who have committed grave misdeeds may be\\nreborn. it is said to be a cube 20,000 yojanas (240,000 to 300,000 kilometers)\\nto a side, buried deep underneath the divine (nonvisible) earth.[2] avīci is\\noften translated into english as \"interminable\" or \"incessant\", referring to\\nsuffering without periods of respite, although it is believed to be ultimately\\nimpermanent.  \\n>buddhism teaches that going to naraka is temporary, allowing the offenders to\\nwork off the karma they garnered in life. avīci is sometimes cited as lasting\\n3.39738624×1018 or 339,738,624×1010 years, about 3.4 quintillion years.  \\n  \\n>the lotus sutra provides an example of humans who have to endure long-term\\nsuffering in avīci. some sutras state that rebirth in avīci will be for\\ninnumerable kalpas (aeons). when the offending soul passes away after one\\nkalpa, it is reborn in the same place, suffering for another kalpa, and on and\\non until it has exhausted its bad karma. for this reason, the avīci hell is\\nalso known as the \"nonstop way\" (無間道).  \\nidk if \"forever\" is the right term, but how can we even began to understand\\ntimespans of quintillions of years? it\\'s unfathomable.\\n\\n souls are not real, not in the sense that you think are.  \\nsouls are not

service, work in public projects or\\ncharitable work for a set amount of time. this ensures that the vote is\\nvalued, and only given to those willing to sacrifice for the good of soceity\\nto attain it. citizenship is, naturally, a pre-requisite for public office.  \\n5\\\\. school system has history, classics and language as core elements, and\\nalso philosophy. children are taught to meditate

willing to sever the national branch from any\\nglobal entity.  \\n8\\\\. culture is seen as a manifestation of national evolution, and traditional\\nincarnations thereof are championed, though there is still artistic freedom,\\nand the arts are championed as the transcendence of the human condition made\\nmanifest.  \\n9\\\\. immigration is severely curtailed for anything other than absolutely vital\\nprofessionals, with an emphasis on cultures compatible with out own. salafism\\nis banned, and all salafists are deported. anyone convicted of running a\\n\\'sharia court\\', of performing in

the\\nchristian persecution of jews by the local christians and abu karib asad.[1]\\naccording to al-masudi the northern part of hejaz was a dependency of the\\nkingdom of judah,[2] and according to

not wallachia.  \\nin poland, italians are włosi and romanians used to be wołosi. the extra \"o\"\\nin romanians name means that its włosi entered through \"o\"-loving languages -\\nrus\\' langs.

sarmatians, we were the visigoths and part germanic, and we\\nwere she slavs as well.  \\nas a proud nation of warriors, fighters and scoundrels, we have fought time\\nafter time, fight after fight, through war and thunder while carrying the flag\\nof europe as the underdog and as a shield to guard the realms of evropa.  \\n  \\nnot only have we dealt giant blows to the ottoman empire, but we have dared\\nstand against russia as well. our greatest leader had been seen as such a\\ngiant threat that the united states had to step in, in order to execute him.\\nthat’s how great he was. and fuck you, boy, if you say otherwise.  \\ntherefore, i think romania is perhaps the greatest country there is on planet\\nearth. without romanians there would’ve been no white race, thank you.\\n\\n

\\nunder the 1857 constitution of mexico, the vice-president, the attorney\\ngeneral, the foreign secretary, and the interior secretary stood in line to\\nthe presidency. as well as madero, huerta had ousted vice-president josé maría\\npino suárez and attorney general adolfo valles baca.to give the coup d\\'état\\nsome appearance of legality, he had lascuráin, as foreign secretary, assume\\nthe

various pseudo-scientific theories\\nemphasising the superiority of the white race have been abandoned(7). among\\nthe intelligentsia, colour feeling only occurs in the transposed form, that\\nis, as a belief in the innate superiority of the coloured races. this is now\\nincreasingly common among english intellectuals, probably resulting more often\\nfrom masochism and sexual frustration than from contact with the oriental and\\nnegro nationalist movements. even among those who do not feel strongly on the\\ncolour question, snobbery and imitation have a powerful influence. almost any\\nenglish intellectual would be scandalised by the claim that the white races\\nare superior to the coloured, whereas the opposite claim would seem to him\\nunexceptionable even if he disagreed with it. nationalistic attachment to the\\ncoloured races is usually mixed up with the belief that their sex lives are\\nsuperior, and there is a large underground mythology about the sexual prowess\\nof negroes.\\n\\n orwell was so goddamn smart but no one listened to him  \\n>the fact is that socialism, in the form in which it is now presented, appeals\\nchiefly to unsatisfactory or even inhuman types. on the one hand you have the\\nwarm-hearted un-thinking socialist, the typical working-class socialist, who\\nonly wants to abolish poverty and does not always grasp what this implies. on\\nthe other hand, you have the intellectual, book-trained socialist, who\\nunderstands that it is necessary to throw our present civilization down the\\nsink and is quite willing to do so. and this type is drawn, to begin with,\\nentirely from the middle class, and from a rootless town-bred section of the\\nmiddle class at that. still more unfortunately, it includes--so much so that\\nto an outsider it even appears to be composed of--the kind of people i have\\nbeen discussing; the foaming denouncers of the bourgeoisie, and the more-\\nwater-in-your-beer reformers of whom shaw isthe prototype, and the astute\\nyoung social-literary climbers who are communists now, as they will be\\nfascists five years hence, because it is all the go, and all that dreary tribe\\nof high-minded\\' women and sandal- wearers and bearded fruit-juice drinkers who\\ncome nocking towards the smell of \\'progress\\' like bluebottles to a dead cat.\\nthe ordinary decent person, who is in sympathy with the

>>8729685  \\nyes because they lost anatolia which was a key territory in their recruitment\\nsystem. the byzantine empire after the komnenian restoration was really\\nfragile\\n\\n >>8729677  \\nno idea. all i know is that the early hand cannon would\\'ve been most useful\\nfor dealing with cavalry and heavy armor, so it saw a lot of use in europe.\\n\\n >>8727810  \\nuntil the early modern era, things were rarely about military technology,\\ntactics, or doctrine. knights were strong because they were the elite fighters\\nof their society, which was decentralized in such a way to support and produce\\na huge number of them. on his own a knight wasn\\'t any better or worse than a\\nbyzantine or muslim elite cavalryman, but the centralized states they served\\ncould only afford so many of them at a time. as these imperial states shrank\\nover time due to political instability, so did their numbers.\\n\\n >>8729715  \\nhow is a european knight with land different from a byzantine soldier with\\nland?\\n\\n >>8729702  \\nyes but how did they stopped the turks at the time from overrunning them? how\\ndid the crusaders even got over the giant city walls?\\n\\n >>8729787  \\nbecause they had support from a byzantine monarch and the empire was in a\\ncivil war. the greeks weren\\'t exactly expecting a siege.\\n\\n >>8729644  \\n>bullshit muslims were usually the ones with the number advantage  \\nit\\'s a common meme, but wildly misunderstood. muslim numbers are a result of\\ntheir currency-based logistics which meant they had an enormous merchant\\nsupply chain following their armies. the vast majority of men weren\\'t there to\\nfight, but to profit off the economy a well-paid muslim army could create by\\nworking logistics or as laborers.  \\n  \\nwhen fighting men were compared, the latins usually had the advantage\\nespecially in regard to heavy cavalry elites, as a muslim state usually paid\\nupkeep for theirs and couldn\\'t train and equip as many men as a kingdom like\\nfrance could call up for a season of fighting. this gap was further widened by\\nthe major population advantage european states had, and which kept growing\\nwith every century.  \\n  \\nthe only huge but effective muslim armies were tribal confederations, like the\\nearly seljuks, almoravids and almohads, and the early caliphates, and even\\nthese included a large number of non-combatant family members who followed\\ntheir men in camps.\\n\\n >>8729731  \\nhe\\'s not, which is the point. the difference is more political, where the\\nbyzantine soldier with land is meant to be solely loyal to the emperor but\\nlocal politics forces him to either sell his land and become a mercenary or to\\njoin up with a local governor for protection. for a knight this was not only a\\ngiven, but expected, and his call to arms was all about answering whoever he\\nserved directly, and that relationship could persist over several generations\\nwhereas a tax-farmer in the near east wasn\\'t assured of the same continuity.\\n\\n >>8729826  \\nwhile i agree, i think this really depends on how far in the crusade you look.\\nafter the siege of constantinople most of the horses were eaten and i\\'m pretty\\nsure bohemond rode an ox into battle or something ridiculous like that.\\n\\n >>8729854  \\nyes, but remember the knights were not their horses, and in this period the\\nknight wasn\\'t the sort of cavalry-specific specialist he evolved to become in\\nthe next century. this still left the latins around a few thousand knights,\\nwhich while tiny compared to the tens of thousands of the seljuk forces very\\nlikely outnumbered the total number of emirs and their personal guards who\\nmight compare in their equipment, support, and training and experience, never\\nmind that the latins were in a single host while the seljuks were divided into\\nmultiple factions scattered in different camps.\\n\\n >>8727810  \\nthe technology advantage i would say would be after qianlong\\'s ten great\\ncampaigns where the chinese field artillery development stalled and europe\\nentered the beginning of the industrial revolution, so around the beginning of\\nthe 19th century. certain advancements of the europeans did exist such as\\nshipbuilding and artillery fortifications, but there were not insurmountable\\nuntil then.\\n\\n >>8721147  \\nshocking, right?\\n\\n

was no real reason why a prussian in konigsberg and an alsatian in\\nstrasbourg would have been considered \"kinsmen\" before 1871  \\nthats simply wrong.  \\nthings like the march revolution or the frankfurt parliament would have never\\ntaken place if the people in the various german states didnt considered\\nthemselves kinsmen. heaps of writings from before 1871 shows that the german\\npeople considered themselves germans long before 1871. even mozart considered\\nhimself as a german.  \\n  \\n>before 1871, their dialects were not even mutually intelligible  \\nhigh german was a thing

>>8725423  \\nyou need biodiversity because it results in an increased likelihood of some\\nplants or animals warding off disease. if it\\'s just one species occupying a\\nniche, it might get wiped out in its entirety in such an event. look up the\\nhistory of the banana. did you know that until the 1950s the main variant of\\nthe banan that was grown for commercial purposes was the gros michel? nowadays\\nthis variant is virtually extinct because it was ravaged by a fungal disease.\\na typical problem for monocultures. the cavandish banana is what people mainly\\neat today, because that variant was the next best thing immune to the disease\\nwhich had killed off gros michel. if gros michel had been the only banana in\\nexistence at the time, nobody safe for the hyper rich would have ever eaten\\nanother banana again. even so, the gros michel is generally considered to have\\nbeen the superior product by those who knew it, as it is said to have had a\\nricher flavor. humanity did lose something despite being able to replace gros\\nmichel.  \\n  \\nyou might argue, well, it\\'s just bananas, even if they went extinct\\ncompletely, the ecosphere would still function. but simply try to imagine if\\nthe same happened to a more vital component of the biosphere. in recent times\\nscientists have been alarmed by colony collapse disorder killing off large\\nnumbers of bees. if bees went extinct, the economic consequences would be far,\\nfar worse than the disappearance of bananas, and we can\\'t exactly just sit\\naround and wait a couple million years for another species to evolve into\\noccupying the niche and taking up the slack.\\n\\n >>8725242  \\nbased\\n\\n >>8725101  \\nhumans are a perfect place to draw the line though. if you try and say \"well,\\nthese humans are superior to those ones\" the guys you\\'re killing are going to\\nfight back, and you start wars and crap. animals can\\'t fight wars against\\npeople to defend themselves. also, if you make the cutoff point at humans if\\nanother species ever comes along as powerful as we are (such as aliens), we\\nare free to kill and torture them too so that we can remain above all other\\nforms of life. and i truly do think that if we ever found aliens we should\\ngenocide them immediately because they could be a threat. i love humanity, i\\nwant us to always be the best. it\\'s okay if you don\\'t think all humans are\\nequal, i can respect that and can even agree with it somewhat (although i base\\nmy judgement on what makes a human superior/inferior on their choices in life\\nrather than their genetics) but even the lowest human is still above the\\nhighest animal in my opinion.  \\n  \\nhow about you tell me your side of things? why do you think the cutoff point\\nshouldn\\'t be at humans? i know you\\'re probably just going to parrot my shit\\nback at me but you change a couple words to make it sound racist or something,\\npeople like to do that to seem clever, but it just

consistently anthropomorphized in ancient cultures; the\\nzoocephalic deities of the aztecs and egyptians, the metamorphoses of greece,\\nthe animal spirits of many animistic cultures, and so on. still, these\\ncultures ate animals; the only major difference between their attitudes\\ntowards animals and those found in, say, christian society, was often a\\nrespect or low level of veneration directed towards livestock or game for\\nsacrificing their own lives so that people might live.\\n\\n >>8728423  \\ni don\\'t think there was any anthropomorphizing of animals from any ancient\\nculture. hindus will worship cows but they don\\'t humanize them and try to\\ntreat them like people. these ancient civilizations recognized something\\ndivine in animals but like you said, they also recognize them as animals and\\nate them. vegans would see this as a type of cannibalism so there\\'s clearly\\nsomething different going on.\\n\\n >>8718287  \\nwhat is the point of being moral? what does it do for you? being moral is\\nsimply one mans idea, it is not even real. not eating animals will have\\nconsequences on the human, it is quite obvious that we have to eat them.\\nfollow nature, and not man made morals.\\n\\n >>8728533  \\nnature is an evil system that rewards whoever rapes and steals the most. that\\nmight sound cool until you\\'re the one getting raped and stolen from. being\\nmoral is one of those things where if you do it but nobody else does it it\\nsucks, but if everyone tried to be moral the world is a much better place.\\nthink of it like the prisoner;s dilemma, where if both prisoners stay quiet\\nand don\\'t rat out the other there is the least amount of time spent in prison\\nby everyone. just like how if everyone tries to be moral there is the least\\namount of evil in the world.  \\n  \\nthat said, i still don\\'t think it\\'s necessary to be vegan if you want to be\\nmoral. i am blatantly speciesist against all non-humans and there isn\\'t a lot\\nthat can change my mind. in fact, i think animal cruelty laws should be\\nlifted, just to further the gap between animals and humans place in society.\\n\\n >>8728462  \\nand i\\'m saying that you\\'re using a different idea of \"anthropomorphization\"\\nthan what is commonly understood. to \"anthropomorphize\" something is to assign\\nit human qualities, which is something that ancient cultures did with animals,\\nespecially in mythology: every culture has myths involving animals that think,\\nspeak, and have human emotions to one degree or another, from the eastern\\nwoodlands story \"the ball-game of the animals\" to aesop\\'s fables in greece to\\nanansi in africa to the tongue-cut sparrow in japan.  \\n  \\ni therefore hold that there is another phenomenon besides simple\\nanthropomorphization behind the shift in culture from a respect of animals and\\ngratitude towards them for the sacrifice they must occasionally make for the\\nsake of humans to both the treatment of animals as having completely equal\\nmoral weight to humans (i suppose one might call this a \"total\\nanthropomorphization\", wherein animals are not simply seen as having traits in\\ncommon with humans, but as being a type of human in every meaningful sense of\\nthe word) and the attitude displayed here >>8728639 where animals are seen as\\nnot deserving any form of respect or good treatment and exist solely for the\\nutility they can provide to humans (a divorcing of animals from human life).\\none might say that christian faith is a root cause of this, but i would\\ndispute this, both because we can see this change in attitude even in\\ncountries where christian thought has very little cache in the public\\nconsciousness (such as china) and because, even in places and times where\\nchristianity had a monopoly on the public worldview there was still a\\nprevailing attitude wherein certain animals (domestic ones) had a nobility and\\nmerited certain standards of treatment.\\n\\n >>8729279  \\ntldr, take meds schizo\\n\\n >>8729279  \\nwhat, therefore, caused this? i would say the shift globally towards urban and\\nsuburban life caused by the industrial revolution, which in turn led to more\\nand more people living apart from wildlife and livestock. this has created a\\nshift in the public consciousness, as their views of animals become limited to\\npets with very little \"wildness\" in them, urban scavengers, and zoo animals\\n(which naturally will behave very differently than wild animals, no matter how\\nmuch effort is placed into replicating their natural habitat). with a detached\\nframe of reference from the natural world, the public consciousness has thus\\nshifted to viewing all animals either as being part of the \"human family\" in\\nthe same way that pets are often seen as part of an individual family unit, or\\nas mere objects at best, and antagonistic parasites at worst. notably, in\\nrural areas that are located in more \"natural\" locations, you can still see\\nthe earlier attitudes of respect for wildlife and their similarities to\\nhumanity while still acknowledging their differences.  \\n  \\n>>8729293  \\nthis is /his/, which is supposed to be a board where more thought is given to\\nissues than, say, /b/.\\n\\n >>8729369  \\nin addition, where is the \"schizo\" content in my post? i tried to be pretty\\nclear and unambiguous while giving the topic the thought it\\'s due. should i\\nhave just blamed the jews/liberals/conservatives/nazis/boomers?\\n\\n i\\'d like to believe that maybe we can have a symbiotic relationship with some\\nanimals, getting something from them without being considered exploitation.\\nsome animals even benefit from our help, like sheep, yaks and similar animals.\\nif the animals are kept in good conditions and live happily, i think it can\\nstart being considered ethical. something further down the path of free\\nranges? though lastly one would have to solve the problem of animal consent\\n(essentially animal free will) to reach a good final answer.  \\n  \\ni can imagine myself going vegetarian, i\\'d miss chicken and chourizo but maybe\\ni\\'d get used it. going full vegan and losing eggs and dairy, though, that is\\ntoo much for me.\\n\\n >>8718287\\n\\n morality is an adaptation that evolved like every other trait. it\\'s a set of\\nbehavioral responses that help us to survive, and it may not necessarily fit\\nour current environment. killing animals and eating meat is moral or immoral\\ndepending on the effects that

good point, thank you for bringing it up:  \\n  \\nwhen you say \"the holocaust didn\\'t happen\" what you\\'re actually doing is\\nagreeing with the idea that \"the holocaust therefore x\", but rather by\\nnegation: if the holocaust happened, x would be good to do, but because it\\ndidn\\'t x is not good to do. but morality is works in both directions, so\\nsaying \"the holocaust didn\\'t happen therefore we shouldn\\'t do x\" is the same\\nas just saying \"the holocaust did happen but that doesn\\'t mean that we should\\ndo x\" which is open disagreement with the moral point.  \\n  \\nthis means that you can actually disagree with the holocaust, but only in one\\ndirection, by actually agreeing and amplifying the message. saying that hitler\\nonly gassed 5 million jews is absolutely abominable, but saying that he gassed\\n7 million jews is good. in fact, it\\'s laudable! stack as many bodies on the\\npyre as you can! don\\'t forget about the 77 trillion jews gassed at auschwitz,\\nand all of the slavs, the jehovah\\'s witnesses, the gays, the muslims (strictly\\nspeaking only jews died in the holocaust, as the holocaust by definition\\nrefers solely to the genocide of jews, but this is a technicality that only\\njews actually care about).  \\n  \\nwhy? because it reinforces the moral point: the holocaust happened, therefore\\nx. only now, the holocaust is even worse, because it\\'s not that hitler gassed\\nsix million jews at auschwitz, but rather that hitler gassed seven million\\njews at auschwitz, therefore we need to do x even more. this is why there\\'s no\\nofficial (or at least authoritative) attempts to squash things like the\\nmasturbation machines, the holocauster, the nazis making jews run really fast\\ninto painted mountains, or big

reformed into\\nregiments consisted of two battalions with affiliated militia. the local\\nrecruitment for each regiment was never really implemented, in practice men\\nwere sent to whatever regiment had space. there had been for a while quite a\\nfew ’highland’ designated counties and the situation remained after the\\nreforms, thanks to lobbying. the underpopulated highlands were overrepresented\\ncompared to other parts of the country especially cities, although strangely\\nthe highland light infantry were the ‘city of glasgow’ regiment despite being\\nin the lowlands. so yh it would of been common to find irish, welsh, scots and\\nenglish in counties from not their home area.  \\n  \\nif your g-grandfather joined during the war then in might either be he was\\nliving in

famous ‘pals battalions’ which were recruited at the start of the\\nwar in the initial euphoria at the start of the war, and probably just ended\\nup where they needed space at the time.\\n\\n highland units had a lot of flair and popularity, due to their previous\\nsuccess. there where a few battalions recruited in england that wore kilts and\\npipes.\\n\\n i have met english folk serving in scottish regiments, typically the story is\\nsomething like there great great grandad was a scot who married an english\\nwomen an moved to shireville, all generations since then have chose to spend a\\nfew years in a scottish regiment as a kind of family tradition.  \\n  \\nhistorically there have been times (napoleonic ears in particular) where an\\naverage of 10% of battalions recruited in england where actually scots.  \\n  \\nregional recruiting isn\\'t that strict, necessity or just having a\\ncomprehensible reason for joining a unit from another area is often enough.\\n\\n

the impoverishment of italy and the drain on the empire made it\\nimpossible for the byzantines to hold their gains. only three years after the\\ndeath of justinian in 565, the mainland italian territories fell into the\\nhands of the germanic lombards. the exarchate of ravenna, a band of territory\\nthat stretched across central italy to the tyrrhenian sea and south to naples,\\nalong with parts of southern italy, were the only remaining imperial holdings.\\nafter the gothic wars the empire would entertain no more serious ambitions in\\nthe west. rome would remain under imperial control until the exarchate of\\nravenna was finally conquered by the lombards in 751. some coastal areas of\\nsouthern italy would remain under east roman influence, until the late 11th\\ncentury, while the interior would be ruled by lombard dukes based at benevento\\nand later also at salerno and capua.[53]\\n\\n >>8728120  \\n>can you elaborate on that  \\nwe have very little actual archaeological evidence for the era, most of the\\nshit we have is from later times  \\nconstructs themselves became much more uhhhh fluid, destructible?  \\nthe most essential part of roman architecture for instance, wasn\\'t the fancy\\ntemples or the big baths, it is tile-roofed houses, a luxury effectively\\neveryone enjoyed but wouldn\\'t come back to europe after the early fifth\\ncentury until more than a millenium later. similarly, basic goods like pottery\\nand agricultural tools were really numerous and of incredibly high quality\\neven for the lower income classes. this quality and spread and quantity\\nwouldn\\'t come back until the fourteenth to fifteenth centuries.  \\nthis is not from italy or spain but it\\'s worth pointing out that the germanic\\nroyal court of northumbria has left a poorer, less impressive archaeological\\nfootprint than a small agricultural settlement of roman times in the region\\nthat couldn\\'t have numbered more than 50 people.  \\n>the muslim moors

might have had\\npreviously with the vandal conquests and even the highly simplified cities\\n(they were only cities in a very primitive, aristotelian sense, a lot of\\nvillages strung together with a

then it either falls apart entirely or\\nit is taken into a new direction by whoever leads the nazis next. i don\\'t want\\nto get into the strasserism/standard nazism minutiae because i think if the\\nnazis wanted to get into power they would have to abandon the strasserists and\\nkiss the industrialists\\' and old guard\\'s asses like they did irl. that and the\\nnazi party got mass support from the germans and were elected. not saying they\\ncouldnt be like mussolini and just march on berlin per se, but they would need\\nto get sufficient support from the military to take power, and they didnt\\ntrust each other at best when they took over. maybe the communists would stand\\na better chance but if they did i feel like the military would make its peace\\nwith the fascists or vice

i can\\'t tell\\nif his would have been more memorable.\\n\\n >>8728700  \\nweimar germany continues on until the 1940s. it doesn\\'t militarize heavily or\\ngain any land (it\\'s unlikely stuff such as the austrian anschluss would have\\nhappened without nazi meddling), and it has to deal with sporadic communist\\nand fascist violence.  \\nthe soviet union continues to expand and takes the baltic states and starts\\nthe winter war as normal. in response, germany, uk, france and poland begin\\ndrawing closer together.  \\njapan starts the war in china but never seizes french indochina. as a result\\nthe netherlands, united states, and british commonwealth never create an oil\\nembargo on japan, so it is free to continue its invasion of china unopposed,\\nalthough china still gets material support, including from germany.  \\n  \\nall in all, it\\'s highly unlikely ww2 starts in this timeline, unless stalin\\'s\\nterritorial ambitions were aggressive enough to warrant a response from the\\nwestern allies. i just don\\'t see all out war happening without hitler\\'s\\nexpansion causing world tension.  \\n  \\na three-way cold war between fascists in asia and europe, western democracies\\nin america and europe, and smaller communist alliance is more likely imho.\\nthen it\\'s anybody\\'s guess how eventual decolonization and the first nation to\\ndiscover the nuke could shake that status quo up.  \\n  \\n>>8728929  \\nfootnote for sure, he hadn\\'t done anything memorable. he\\'d be seen favorably\\nif he\\'d died at something like the berlin olympics or before barbarossa. can\\nyou imagine the canonization of hitler if he\\'d succesfully conquered so much\\nof western and northern europe but died just before invading russia? assuming\\ngermany still would have lost /his/ would have \"hitler would have won the war\\nin russia!!!!\" threads daily.\\n\\n >>8728929  \\nhe\\'d be remembered as a farcical failed attempt to do the kapp putsch again. a\\nfootnote among specialist historians and unknown to the wider public.  \\n  \\n>>8728700  \\ngermany would have degenerated into a more and more authoritarian dictatorship\\nand probably turned back towards conservative participatory governance as the\\nworld economy recovered. there might have been more civil unrest for a few\\nyears due to the lack of public support for the assholes in government, and\\nthat lack of popularity is also why i doubt germany would have actually turned\\naway from democracy mid term. the communist never had enough support to\\noverthrow the government or force it to do anything. without hitler the\\nfascist would have died out in sectarian conflicts about which esoteric branch\\nof their aesthetic movement is the best.  \\n  \\nthere\\'d certainly be no ww ii, and what happens without such a major event is\\nincalculable.\\n\\n >>8729114  \\ni doubt the soviets would have invaded anyone without germany distracting\\nbritain and france. stalin didn\\'t seem as reckless as hitler, and invading all\\nthese countries would be even less defensible than what hitler did in\\n1938-1939.  \\nlikewise i think japan would have faced harsher sanctions than it did\\nhistorically without europe going up in flames. i don\\'t think the pacific war\\nwould have happened without a war in europe either. i assume japan would be\\nforced to make some kind

million people which is more than any\\nother river in the world.[3][4]  \\n  \\n>the ganges suffers from extreme pollution levels,[120] caused by the 400\\nmillion people who live close to the river.[121][122] sewage from many cities\\nalong the river\\'s course, industrial waste and religious offerings wrapped in\\nnon-degradable plastics add large amounts of pollutants to the river as it\\nflows through densely populated areas.[9][123][124] the problem is exacerbated\\nby the fact that many poorer people rely on the river on a daily basis for\\nbathing, washing, and cooking.[123] it has also been suggested that eighty\\npercent of all illnesses in india and one-third of deaths can be attributed to\\nwater-borne diseases.[e]  \\n  \\n>varanasi, a city of one million people that many pilgrims visit to take a\\n\"holy dip\" in the ganges, releases around 200 million litres of untreated\\nhuman sewage into the river each day, leading to large concentrations of\\nfaecal coliform bacteria.[123] according to official standards, water safe for\\nbathing should not contain more than 500 faecal coliforms per 100 ml, yet\\nupstream of varanasi\\'s ghats the river water already contains 120 times as\\nmuch, 60,000 faecal coliform bacteria per 100 ml.[125][126]  \\n  \\n>it is a most sacred river to hindus,[5] and worshiped as the goddess ganga in\\nhinduism.[6]\\n\\n >>8718918  \\n>after the cremation of the deceased at varanasi\\'s ghats the bones and ashes\\nare thrown into the ganges. however, in the past thousands of uncremated\\nbodies were thrown into the ganges during cholera epidemics, spreading the\\ndisease. even today, holy men, pregnant women, people with leprosy/chicken\\npox, people who have been bitten by snakes, people who have committed suicide,\\nthe poor, and children under 5 are not cremated at the ghats but are left to\\nfloat free, in order to decompose in the waters. in addition, those who cannot\\nafford the large amount of wood needed to incinerate the entire body, leave\\nbehind a lot of half burned body parts.[127][128]  \\n  \\n>after passing through varanasi, and receiving 32 streams of raw sewage from\\nthe city, the concentration of fecal coliforms in the river\\'s waters rises\\nfrom 60,000 to 1.5 million,[125][126] with observed peak values of 100 million\\nper 100 ml.[123] drinking and bathing in its waters therefore carries a high\\nrisk of infection.[123]  \\n  \\n>the incidence of water-borne and enteric diseases—such as gastrointestinal\\ndisease, cholera, dysentery, hepatitis a and typhoid—among people who use the\\nriver\\'s waters for bathing, washing dishes and brushing teeth is high, at an\\nestimated 66% per year.[123]\\n\\n >>8718918  \\n>>8718922  \\nthere\\'s some kind

just like the pantheon of any\\nother ie civilizations, although it was mixed with ivc fire rituals in\\npractice. everything after is definitely not purely indo-european since the\\ntribal herders basically got their culture completely absorbed into the indus\\nvalley civilization so the other vedas, the upanishads, the puranas, the\\nmahabharata, etc. are all unmistakably indian and draw from contemporary\\nindian ideas. unlike what varg tweets between spazzing out and drooling on\\nhimself, the buddha and much of buddhist thought in all three schools derived\\nmuch of their starting philosophy from indian hinduism - samsara, karma,\\nmoksha, nirvana, etc.\\n\\n >>8719270  \\n>rigveda  \\nvotive/sacrificial hymns, with a bit of philosophical musing in the later\\nparts of the

aryans entered\\nindia. certainly, the cultural package shown in the rigveda is closer to old\\nindo-iranian steppe culture than it was to later indian culture, but already\\nwe see changes, i.e. the later philosophical hymns.  \\n  \\n>upanishads/puranas  \\nearly religious works from the new vedic civilization, which arose from the\\npost-ivc dark age in the early/mid 1st millenium bc. by this

crazy mythological tales.  \\n  \\n>mahabharata  \\nat its core, the indian iliad, telling the story of two feuding human clans\\nbacked by different parties of gods. but it got super bloated as

mantras,\\ndeities, chanting,entertainment with lengthy scriptures with thousands of\\nverses, sacrifice and sacred objects, and rules for lay people in order to\\ncreate a religion.  \\nfor the hindus and mahyanaists, people have the knowledge that they have a\\ntrue nature, but people are misguided on what they take as their true nature.\\nthis is why the hindus say that people are already enlightened, they just do\\nnot know about it... the true nature of people is not the 5 senses or their\\nobjects, but the mind itself with theworld [loka] itself identified with the\\ncosmos, or their deification of this, ie their brahma or their buddha or non-\\nduality, and when people realize this they are enlightened. the way to realize\\nthis is by relying on lots of sacrifice, chantings and rituals, also on\\nmaterial objects which magically purify the minds for them, like sounds,\\nlogic, mantras, little beads, amulets.  \\n  \\nit is only when there is a alledgedly good creator [a

ideas.\\npeople get enlightened when they stop craving for those. the way to get\\nenlightened is to purify the mind, however not with useless chantings and\\nrituals nor with magical objects, unlike the hindus do, but with the mind\\nitself, ie all the time inclining [with the mind] the mind towards what the\\nbuddha calls good qualities and then directly knowing the mind as it really\\nis, which is anicca, dukkha, anatta [contrary to what the hindus say], which\\nis the condition for dispassion, dispassion which is the condition for\\nliberation, liberation which is the condition for direct
